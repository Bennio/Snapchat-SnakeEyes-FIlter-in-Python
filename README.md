# Snapchat-SnakeEyes-FIlter-in-Python

USAGE

You'll need to download the shape_predictor_68 from dlib-models and unzip it in this directory first.

After, you should be able to just pass in the location of that predictor to the Python3 program as a command line argument like so:

$ python3 eye-glitch.py -predictor shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat and by pressing 's' you can use the eye snake.
